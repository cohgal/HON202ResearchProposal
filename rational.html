      <h1>Public Transportation Research Proposal Project</h1>
      <h2>Rational</h2>
      <p>I am interested in further exploring the following questions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do users of the public transportation system in Portland, OR perceive it as accessible, safe, and reliable? 
        <li>What are the unique needs and challenges Portland’s transit-depending riders face in their effort to commute safely, effectively, and conveniently? 
      <p>
        To answer the questions above, it is helpful to divide Portland’s transit system. The system consists of bus lines and a streetcar, both operating mainly on the same lanes as private vehicles. A light rail train, MAX, operates on dedicated rails if it is outside of downtown, where it integrates with car lanes. Though MAX trains use their own lanes, where cars are prohibited to drive through, in most downtown streets there is no physical barrier between cars and MAX trains, leaving the trains to cruise at low speeds to protect pedestrians.

            A possible hypothesis is that the system in Portland is lacking reach to numeral neighborhoods, offers many low frequency lines, and is facing some unique challenges, regarding passengers’ safety and sense of security while waiting to their rides, or onboard. The absolute majority of all three means of transit’s stops are located on street level and often share lanes with cars and bikers. While increasing accessibility, this may reduce efficiency and safety for users on the system and those around it, by generating conflicts with pedestrians and bikers and reducing cruise speeds in crowded areas.

            If this hypothesis is confirmed, alongside with detailed qualitative information, it will raise an opportunity to design improvements and renovations to the system, that will benefit the public in Portland, and may contribute to the multiple discourse communities. Since the problem is social at its core, discussing ethics, racial and social injustices, and how they affect diverse communities’ access to urban mobility, the discussion is first and foremost relevant to the humanities and social sciences. In the pursue of an answer to these complex problems, I hope to reveal aspects of human-centered design and expend our knowledge on engineering and development of transportation and other urban complex systems. Thus, this discussion is also relevant to the engineering discourse community.

            If this hypothesis is disconfirmed, qualitative data will indicate what characteristics of Portland’s public transit systems are working well, and how they stand when comparing to the city’s character and properties. This information may serve as an example to other comparable cities and shed a light on the strengths of the system. It is very likely that some problems and challenges in the system will be discovered, and those may suggest further research possibilities and/or improvements to the system.
