      <h1>Public Transportation Research Proposal Project</h1>
      <h2>Methods and Design</h2>
      <h3>focus Groups</h3>
      <p>To estimate the current situation as it is perceived by transit users in Portland, focus groups would be formed. To create diverse focus groups, participants will be recruited via verity of ways: advertisements in local papers, flyers on transit, letters sent to riders’ homes (possibly as indicated by TriMet database, if legally allowed to provide information, and if authorized by IRB). They will discuss the following aspects: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessibility, with regards to location of stops and lines, disability accommodations, and service fares. 
        <li>Safety, with regards to law enforcement, COVID-19 regulations, and controlled access to the systems (gates / closed stations / open on street level). 
          <li>Convenience, with regards to travel time, service frequencies, and accurate schedule and maps. 
      </ul>
      <p>
        The participants will be initially presented with a questionnaire to group them to other users with similar needs from the transit system. They will receive compensations for the time they spend in those discussion groups. A researcher will be present in those discussions, and guide them through open-ended questions, intended to simulate a group discussion. The session will be recorded, after obtaining consent from participants, and later analyzed and coded to uncover themes. The intention of those discussions is to obtain qualitative information about the users’ needs and find themes between them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While group discussions don’t guarantee clear and objective results, it is expected that with each participant’s story and/or comment, other participants’ memory will be activated, and those memories and experiences will uncover valuable, relevant information. 
      </p>
      <h3>Existing Data</h3>
      <p>
        TriMet usage information is publicly available and can be accessed to collect official statistics about public transportation usage (Ridership and Performance Statistics, n.d.). This data can be later used for analysis and comparison between the official data and the experience perceived by the users, to draw conclusions on the disposition between the system intention, design, and execution. 
      </p>
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Questionnaires, transcripts from discussion groups, and publicly available data will be organized and coded with ‘accessibility’, ‘safety’, ‘convenience’, ‘integration’, and any other reoccurring themes, discovered during the data collection process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncovering themes of limited reach of service, low frequencies, concerns about safety, and traffic integration problems due to TriMet’s on-street operations will confirm our hypothesis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Uncovering themes of passengers’ satisfaction about those issues will disconfirm our hypothesis. With that, it is likely that other concerns will be discovered, and the updated, current data will be valuable in improving the public transportation system in the Portland area.
