      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        To better understand the characteristics of an ideal public transportation system, I suggest that it is valuable to define the word ‘public’: according to Cambridge Dictionary, it is “relating to or involving people in general, rather than being limited to a particular group of people”. Relying on this or a similar definition and recognizing that each environment is made of different people, it is likely that there is no one solution to this problem. However, I suggest four categories that summarize people’s needs from a transportation system: accessibility, safety, convenience, and integration. 
      </p>
      <p>
        First and foremost, a transportation system for the public must be accessible to the public. People with disabilities, physical or mental, must be able to utilize the system. People who are experiencing financial hardship must be able to access the service, often to get to work. Having a serios financial barrier to access the service might worsen their situation. Limited frequency, quality, and location of services are some of the variables that may prevent minority groups to access and utilize the service. For example, Some existing literature in the field describes the barriers of people with disabilities and financial hardship to utilize the public transportation system in Portland, OR, despite disabilities accommodations and lower fare for people with disabilities, the struggle of families to pay the ride fair on a regular basis, and discrimination regarding the quality of bus stops throughout the city and between different neighborhoods (Lubitow, Rainer, et al., 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, even passengers who are able to access the service, often struggle with safety on their trips: fear of crime-related concerns, more common in female than male passengers (Schafer et al., 2006), concerns about lighting at stations at night, dangers of riding in a crowded bus and more, are some of the reasons passengers are shifting their schedules around the service, rather than using the service at the time they need it the most (Lubitow, Rainer, et al., 2017). Some gender minority groups, for example, experience discrimination, harassment and even violence while using public transportation (Lubitow, Carathers, et al., 2017). With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, other health and safety concerns emerged. Social distancing required making changes to the way people are riding buses and trains. To keep passengers safe, many service providers require reduction in occupancy. At the same time, a dramatical decrease in usage of public transportation altogether have been seen (Kamga & Eickemeyer, 2021). 
      </p>
      <p>
        After designing a system that is both accessible and safe, it is important to ensure that it is convenient and reliable. This challenge can be divided into two steps: first it is necessary to understand and characterize reliability and convenience for different populations. For example, a study done on transit smart card data in Singapore, discovered that commuters who often switch modes of public transportation gave a higher value to travel time than others (Agarwal et al., 2020). Similarly, we can assume that even within a given study area, different populations tend to prefer some requirements more than others, and those preferences not only depend on the rider, but also change from trip to trip, depending on the purpose or even the time during the day. Once the values of convenience and reliability are determined, implementing them is a whole new challenge: transfers between public transit vehicles is often not smooth, and accurately predicting demand and road traffic is not always possible. A study conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineers offers a pioneering mathematical model to increase performances of public transportation, and direct transfers between vehicles, but only serves as a first step in a long and continuous process (Wu et al., 2020). 
      </p>

        Lastly, in an optimal scenario, if a public transportation system is designed to be accessible, safe, and reliable, it is valuable to ensure its integration capabilities: buses, light rail trains and other modes of transportation are often integrated in crowded urban areas. Whether a transit route goes through a dedicated lane, alongside cars, on an elevated lane, or in a tunnel, will have heavy implications on passing traffic, pedestrians, bike riders and other transit riders. When integrated on street-level, Transit Signal Priority is often implemented, and affects the conflicts with other modes of transportation (Song & Noyce, 2019).
